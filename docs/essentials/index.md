# Essentials

The core of this site are the topics we deem essential for doing deep learning: Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus,
and Statistics. The essentials will give you the theory and tools needed to be able to start your journey in machine 
learning. By no means will these sections cover all information there is to give about the topics, so please use these
notes as a starting point for you own journey. We will list a series of book recommendations to further your research
in [this section](../../further_reading).
