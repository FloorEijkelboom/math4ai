# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra serves as a core of most machine learning algorithms that you will encounter throughout the course, 
as the majority of objects are represented as vectors and matrices (matrices are called arrays/tensors in NumPy/PyTorch). 
For this reason, we will systematically revise all the essential concepts such as vectors, matrices, linear operators, 
and determinants. To intuitively explain certain concepts, we will use jargon which will be denoted in _italic_ font.
